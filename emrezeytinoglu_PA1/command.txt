              with -l, print the author of each file
              with  -l,  scale  sizes  by  SIZE  when  printing  them;   e.g.,
       -c     with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last modification of
              file status information); with -l: show ctime and sort by  name;
       -f     do not sort, enable -aU, disable -ls --color
              across -x, commas -m, horizontal -x, long -l, single-column  -1,
              verbose -l, vertical -C
              like -l --time-style=full-iso
       -g     like -l, but do not list owner
              with -l and -s, print sizes like 1K 234M 2G etc.
       -H, --dereference-command-line
       --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir
       -l     use a long listing format
              like -l, but list numeric user and group IDs
       -N, --literal
       -o     like -l, but do not list group information
              with -l, WORD determines which time to show;  with  --sort=time,
              time/date format with -l; see TIME_STYLE below
       -u     with  -lt:  sort by, and show, access time; with -l: show access
       2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).
